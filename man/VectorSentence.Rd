\usage{
VectorSentence(x, y = NA, OxfordComma = T, End = "and ", hyphenate = 3,
  messageLevel = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of values, some subset of which are to be listed in the
ouput string}

\item{y}{a logical vector of the same length as /code{x}, indicating whether
each element should be included}

\item{OxfordComma}{logical, should the Oxford (or serial) comma be used?}

\item{End}{what word or phrase should be inserted prior to the final element
in the list?}

\item{hyphenate}{what is the min # of consecutive elements that will be
hyphenated? If <2, no hyphenation.}
}
\value{
atomic character
}
\description{
Create a natural language, comma separated list
}
\note{
This function creates a string that lists the selected elements of a
  vector.  The elements will be separated by commas, including the Oxford
  comma (if OxfordComma = T). If there are runs of consecutive elements
  selected, they will be grouped using hyphenation (if hyphenate > 1).
  Hyphenation refers to abbreviating a run of consecutive elements by using
  just the first and last, separated by a hyphen

# Sample Data 1
x = c(as.character(1:4), "5a", "5b", "5c", as.character(6:41),"D1", "D2", "D3a", "D4a", "D5", "D6", "Essay", letters[5:20])
y = sample(c(T, F), size = length(x), replace = TRUE) # elements to use
if (sum(y) < length(y)/2){y = !y}                     # make sure at least half of the elements are True

# Test Run 1
# look at the stuff

VectorSentence(x, y, OxfordComma = F, End = "and ", hyphenate = 2) # turn off the oxford comma and hyphenate pairs
